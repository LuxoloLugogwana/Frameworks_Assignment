# Baby Monitoring Research Dataset Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a Baby Monitoring research dataset to extract meaningful insights about infant health metrics, demographic patterns, and medical trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and the creation of an interactive Streamlit web application.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on baby health metrics
- Identify patterns in birth weights, temperature, and oxygen saturation
- Analyze gender distribution and demographic trends
- Create interactive visualizations and build a Streamlit dashboard

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains medical monitoring data with the following key columns:
- `birth_weight_kg`: Infant birth weight in kilograms
- `temperature_c`: Body temperature in Celsius
- `oxygen_saturation`: Blood oxygen saturation percentage
- `gender`: Baby's gender classification
- `birth_date`: Date of birth records
- Various other medical and demographic metrics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application
- **WordCloud**: Text data visualization
- **Scipy**: Statistical analysis

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually install:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit wordcloud scipy
   ```

3. **Run the data analysis:**
   python babymonitor.ipynb
 

4. **Launch the Streamlit app:**
   python -m streamlit run babymonitorr.py
  

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Demographic Analysis
- **Gender Distribution**: Balanced distribution with slight male predominance (51.5% male, 48.5% female)
- **Name Trends**: Common names followed typical naming patterns with regional variations

### 2. Health Metrics Analysis
- **Birth Weight**: Normal distribution with mean ≈ 3.25 kg (range: 1.8-4.9 kg)
- **Temperature**: Stable around 36.8°C with minimal variance in healthy ranges
- **Oxygen Saturation**: Strong correlation with overall health status

### 3. Correlation Insights
- Weak negative correlation between temperature and oxygen saturation
- Birth weight showed no significant correlation with other vital metrics

## 🎨 Streamlit Application Features

The interactive dashboard includes:

- **📊 Real-time Data Filtering**: Sliders and dropdowns for interactive exploration
- **🌡️ Temperature Analysis**: Distribution charts and statistics
- **👶 Baby Metrics**: Birth weight trends and health indicator correlations
- **📋 Data Explorer**: Raw data preview with filtering capabilities
- **📈 Multiple Visualization Types**: Scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and box plots

## ⚠️ Challenges & Learning Points

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Data Quality Issues**: Missing values in critical columns required careful imputation strategies
2. **Column Name Variability**: Multiple naming conventions for similar metrics needed standardization
3. **Memory Management**: Large dataset size required optimized processing techniques

### Analytical Challenges:
1. **Correlation Interpretation**: Distinguishing causation from correlation in medical data
2. **Outlier Management**: Identifying and handling medical outliers without losing important anomalies
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful derived metrics from raw data

### Key Learnings:
1. **Data Cleaning is Crucial**: 80% of time spent on data preparation significantly impacts analysis quality
2. **Medical Data Sensitivity**: Special handling required for health-related datasets
3. **Visualization Selection**: Choosing the right chart type for different data relationships
4. **Streamlit Development**: Rapid prototyping of data applications with interactive components
